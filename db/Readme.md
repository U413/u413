All SQL queries in u413 are stored in this directory. This gives a cleaner
separation of code and makes longer queries less painful to write.

Subdirectories are used to keep queries separated by type, because otherwise
they'd just be named <type>-<name>.sql which is essentially a worse version
of Subdirectories.
